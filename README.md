# Continuous Action Reinforcement Learning Automaton
This program is using CARLA method in parameter learning.<br/>

## Branch instruction
## master
The basic CARLA method code by C, which also will be packaged on Pypl
## image
Using CARLA method in image processing and image segmentation problem. The main processing of the algorithm will present in the paper.<br/>

## Pretreatment
master: void!!<br/>
image: before you using this method, you need install some package, they are:<br/>
Pillow, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, clooextions, opencv, pandas, gap_stat, sklearn<br/>

## Usage
###master
Not sure!!

You can change all the parameter(even include the location of file you want to work on it) in the Constant.py. All the parameter you can choose is given in this function<br/>
After variable confident, you can begin the program with<br/>
python3 Main.py<br/>
