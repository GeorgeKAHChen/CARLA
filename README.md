# Continuous Action Reinforcement Learning Automaton and Usage
Here are code about CARLA algorithm and it's usage.<br/>

## Part 1 CARLA in Equation Solve Problem
Actually I don't think it is a gooe method using this algorithm to solve this kind of problem. However, as this is the first time I begin my machine learning algorithm, I want to solve a problem not to difficult.<br/>

## Part 2 CARLA in parameter Leaning
We will discuss the learning of parameter in PID contron system.

## Part 3 CARLA in Multiply Treasholding in Image Processing
This is the main part of problem solution. On the one hand, it is from the project we had done last year. On the other hand, we try to combine this algoritm with RW method, to find a new kind of algorithm which is fast and accurancy.
